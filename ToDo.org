#+title: ToDo

* DONE COMMENT Show you can constraint on via-points or not
** DONE Show if it works mathematically
** Metric of reaching the end point
** DONE Multiple via points
*** [X] Does it loose accuracy when increasing the number of via-points?
* Stitching
** Add a constraint of tangency at the via-point
** Jacobian = zero at via-points
** How to update the piece-wise Gaussian?
EM algo?
** EM algo to update the weights of each piece wise Gaussian with a Jacobian = 0 constraint?
* NO Piece-wise multivariate Gaussian?
Is it possible to update the equations to get one single multivariate Gaussian?
* NO Blending?
[[file:fig/schema-blending.png]]
* Mixture model?
* Using Gaussian Process instead of hierarchical Bayesian model to have a single multivariate Gaussian?
