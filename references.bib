	abstract = {Movement Primitives (MP) are a well-established approach for representing modular and re-usable robot movement generators. Many state-of-the-art robot learning successes are based MPs, due to their compact representation of the inherently continuous and high dimensional robot movements. A major goal in robot learning is to combine multiple MPs as building blocks in a modular control architecture to solve complex tasks. To this effect, a MP representation has to allow for blending between motions, adapting to altered task variables, and co-activating multiple MPs in parallel. We present a probabilistic formulation of the MP concept that maintains a distribution over trajectories. Our probabilistic approach allows for the derivation of new operations which are essential for implementing all aforementioned properties in one framework. In order to use such a trajectory distribution for robot movement control, we analytically derive a stochastic feedback controller which reproduces the given trajectory distribution. We evaluate and compare our approach to existing methods on several simulated as well as real robot scenarios.},

	abstract = {Movement Primitives are a well-established paradigm for modular movement representation and generation. They provide a data-driven representation of movements and support generalization to novel situations, temporal modulation, sequencing of primitives and controllers for executing the primitive on physical systems. However, while many MP frameworks exhibit some of these properties, there is a need for a unified framework that implements all of them in a principled way. In this paper, we show that this goal can be achieved by using a probabilistic representation. Our approach models trajectory distributions learned from stochastic movements. Probabilistic operations, such as conditioning can be used to achieve generalization to novel situations or to combine and blend movements in a principled way. We derive a stochastic feedback controller that reproduces the encoded variability of the movement and the coupling of the degrees of freedom of the robot. We evaluate and compare our approach on several simulated and real robot scenarios.},
